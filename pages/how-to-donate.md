Please see the [full list of donors](donors.html).

We are currently sorting out how SEI can accept donations under the sponsorship of Stanford Libraries. If you would like to donate to SEI, please [email Deborah Anderson](mailto:dwanders@berkeley.edu) to arrange the details.

In-kind contributions are also helpful. SEI is in need of volunteers, as mentioned on our home page.

Donations to SEI help support SEI work. Funds are used primarily to pay script encoding specialists and graduate students to do research, and write script proposals on a per-script basis. Funding also covers research-related travel, administrative costs, and website maintenance. SEI's [progress](https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei/progress-overview.html) web page gives an overview of project achievements.


## How to help

- [Participation from experts](scripts-to-encode.html) on specific scripts as well as monetary support is sought for this project.

- Volunteers who are willing to help pen funding proposals would also be greatly appreciated.

- If you have a particular interest in or information about an unencoded script, [please let us know](mailto:dwanders@berkeley.edu)!

## Assist in fundraising efforts

If you would like to volunteer in our fund-raising efforts (especially to write funding proposals), please contact Deborah Anderson (<dwanders@berkeley.edu>).
