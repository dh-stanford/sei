The project received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, so work will be able to continue for two more years. Grateful thanks for the ongoing support of NEH and other donors!  Work earmarked for the coming year will include extensions to Egyptian Hieroglyphs and Maya hieroglyphs (the latter with support from a Google Research grant and the Unicode Adopt-a-Character program), as well as work on other historic and modern minority scripts.
