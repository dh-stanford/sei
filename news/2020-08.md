Thanks to support from the NEH grant, a new Unicode Technical Note #44 “[Medieval Latin Character Recommendations](https://www.unicode.org/notes/tn44/)” has been posted. The UTN is by David Perry. The NEH grant also supported the creation of a [freely available Unicode-supported Old Italic font and keyboard](http://scholarsfonts.net/old_italic.html), also by David Perry.</p>
